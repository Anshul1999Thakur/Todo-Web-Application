Overview:
A To-Do web application is a simple yet powerful tool that helps users manage their tasks effectively. By leveraging Django, a high-level Python web framework, developers can build a robust, scalable, and secure To-Do application with relative ease. Django's built-in features and modular design allow for rapid development and deployment, making it an ideal choice for such applications.

Steps for Installing a Django To-Do Web Application from GitHub and Creating a Superuser:
Step1. Set up the database by running Django's migration commands:
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate

Step2.Create a superuser account to access the Django admin panel:
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        Follow the prompts to enter a username, email, and password for the superuser.

Step3.Start the Django development server:
        python manage.py runserver
        Your application should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/


Accessing the Admin Panel:
To access the Django admin panel, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ in your web browser and log in using the superuser credentials you created.
